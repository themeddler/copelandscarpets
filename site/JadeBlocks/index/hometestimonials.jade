                        q After realizing the megastores  were not cheaper...we looked at Copeland's.  Prompt friendly service, no cost estimates, more knowledge of carpet and wood choices sealed the deal for us. The installation was fast, flawless and we are extremely pleased. I know that if we ever need anything else with this job or any future flooring needs Copeland's will be there for us.

                        q When we were looking to remodel our kitchen and install wood throughout the house, Copeland's offered us the best pricing in the area. Not only did we find wood that matches perfectly with our furniture, but also beautiful granite for our countertops and natural stone for the backsplash...We highly recommend Copeland's Carpets &amp; More.

                        q We were thrilled with how nice our dark oak floors turned out in the new house and equally thrilled with how efficiently the two jobs were handled...My wife and I recommend Copelandâ€™s to any friends thinking about redoing their master bath, replacing countertops, etc.
