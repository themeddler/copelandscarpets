If local brands are something you've got an eye for then Texas Traditions might be the Southern feel you want in your floors. High-end wood installation is a specialty of Copeland's and custom wood floors are well within our means. Exotic species are carried in-house; however, we can order any type of wood your little heart desires.</P></div><div class="col-sm-7 col-sm-pull-5"><img src="../Assets/img/wood images/woodbrands.jpg" class="img-responsive hidden-xs"/></div></div></div></section>
