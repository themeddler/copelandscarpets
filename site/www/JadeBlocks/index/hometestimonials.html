Prompt friendly service, no cost estimates, more knowledge of carpet and wood choices sealed the deal for us. The installation was fast, flawless and we are extremely pleased. I know that if we ever need anything else with this job or any future flooring needs Copeland's will be there for us.</q><h3>Bob</h3><h4>Plano, TX</h4></div></div></div></div><div class="row smallreview review"><div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-6 col-md-6"><div class="row"><div class="smallquote col-md-10"><q>When we were looking to remodel our kitchen and install wood throughout the house, Copeland's offered us the best pricing in the area.
